  This is a simple game where the user attempts to match the 'points to match' number.

To get started, click a jewel of your choosing and watch your points board add up. 

Each jewel is asigned a random number 1 - 12 and it is your job to do the match to make the numbers match.

If you go over the 'points to match' number you then are awarded with a losing point.

If you match the number then you score a winning point!
